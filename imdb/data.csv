Sonapur is a small village in modern day India that is being terrorized by a bandit named Zakali and his gang of 40 thieves. The villagers, young and old, even the Police, are all terrified. When a new Forest Officer is appointed, the villagers become bold, but Zakali soon forces them to change their minds and kills several people. Then an outcast village woodcutter, Alibaba, comes across Zakali's cave, which is located near Kali Pahadi, a valley that is still inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs, uses the magic words 'Khul Ja Sim Sim', and finds untold wealth in it. He decides to take some and distribute it amongst the poor villagers. Razia, his estranged brother, Qasim's wife, finds out and compels Alibaba to tell her husband the location of the cave. Qasim goes there, grabs as much as he can hold, but is unable to remember the magic words to exit the cave. Shortly thereafter Zakali returns, slices Qasim's body in half and leaves. Alibaba finds his brother's mutilated body, and he and his sweetheart, Marjina, secretly hire a cobbler, Mushtaq Mochee, to sew it together and make it ready for burial, which he does for a fat fee. When Zakali finds Qasim's body missing, he decides to attack Sonapur but is ambushed and many of his men are killed. Zakali then plans to deceive Alibaba, get his wealth back and kill him - and there is no power on Earth that can stop Zakali.",,Sunil Agnihotri,"Farukh Barelvi,Farooq Barelvi","Divya Dwivedi,Azghar,Anwar Fatehan"

It started with an act of terrorism: a dirty bomb -a radioactive attack on American soil that completely devastated the American mid-west and left millions dead or dying. Immediately our government looked to overseas threats -Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan... North Korea... but then the truth came. The attack was not carried out by foreign operatives, but by a coordinated effort of domestic terrorist. America was under attack by its own citizens. The government moved quickly, and with one fell swoop they seized complete control of the country, closing our borders, establishing a curfew, implementing a special police force, and regulating all aspects of our lives. They took control of the internet. Implemented a military draft, took away our firearms, and restricted all air travel. Democrats and Republicans united, and passed a law to give the government complete emergency control for the duration of the crisis. They called this law the United States Security Enforcement Act. It's been nearly 10 years and martial law is still in effect. Unemployment is at 38%. All citizens are tracked through their digital devices. All businesses are owned by the government. Special government police troops patrol the streets, seeking out and detaining suspected terrorist. The population lives in fear. We are prisoners in our own country, held hostage by our own government. Many of us now believe the government was directly responsible for the attacks in the mid-west that killed so many. They used our fear to seize control. The general population starves while the corporate government grows fat. People began to take to the streets, protesting, demanding the truth. The government fought back, detaining and executing thousands in a purge of suspected insurgents. What began as civil unrest may soon become a full scale civil war. This is America. The time is now. My name is Edenfall_318, I'm a journalist, and for the first time since the collapse of America, the truth will be told. This is my story...",,Jason Hawkins,,"Natasha Timpani,Simon Scott,Dara Davey"

The Common Sense,2014,,Sci-Fi,"The Common Sense: Directed by Melanie Gilligan. With Ulysses Castellanos, Pepijn Cladder, Judith Edixhoven, Tina Haidari. New York-based artist Melanie Gilligan's largest project to date, The Common Sense takes the form of a sci-fi film and mini-series which looks at how minds, bodies, and interpersonal relations are shaped by technological advancements within capitalism. This experimental narrative drama tells a story that revolves around a future technology which allows one to directly experience another person's bodily sensations and affect. After a decade of transforming the conditions of work and social life, for the most part in accordance with economic demands, the technology's networks suddenly fail causing massive disorientation. People withdraw and isolate themselves from the public, no longer knowing how to communicate. Once the system comes back online, the story splits into two scenarios: one version shows a period of normalization after the rupture, while in the other people confront the ways that the technology has been exploitatively used for years, some forming social movements to resist the continuation of these conditions.",,Melanie Gilligan,,"Judith Edixhoven,Ulysses Castellanos,Pepijn Cladder"

The Iga ninja, fated to be demolished by Nobunaga Oda, the greatest warlord of the time, have put their people under severe and harsh restrictions, with the upper echelons of the ninja brotherhood ruling their charges with an iron fist. Even the slightest and most minor of infractions can result in a death sentence for members of the lesser ninja, even those few women who number amongst their ranks. One such female ninja is Ukagami (Hijii), a stunning yet formidable warrior, who is sentenced to death by her evil ninja peers when she disobeys her elders and leaves the secret order to track down a kidnapped childhood friend. While on the run, she forges a savage and crimson path of bloodshed that will ultimately lead either to salvation or damnation.

His only interactions are with a supervisor named Face who communicates to Elliot via different video monitors and overhead speakers located throughout the facility. Sentries are always keeping a close eye on Elliot to make sure he stays on task. When Elliot does have a rare moment alone, he plugs into his pod and escapes into another world as an idealized version of himself. The more he explores this alternate universe, the more he desires it, and consequentially, the less he trusts his own reality. As his mind deteriorates from the stress of his job combined with his belief that an artificial world may actually exist, Elliot has no choice but to try and uncover the truth behind his identity before he no longer can.",,Craig Jacobson,,"Craig Jacobson,Joshua Coffy,Cassandra Sechler"

As Nia and Cameron's relationship grows, they conspire to create a more righteous online universe, dishing out justice big and small, but wind up crossing a shadowy outfit called OPTIC, which goes after them for its own nefarious purposes.
